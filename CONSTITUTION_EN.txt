Membership

Objective for reflection
The platform must allow citizens to reflect among themselves. This implies the free expression of everyone's ideas. Reflection on all subjects must be constant and the vote never closed.

Decision objective
The community aims to federate and adopt common, thoughtful, and sustainable decisions. A proposal goes to the decision stage when it obtains 75% of positive votes (+ minimum number of votes).

Participation objective
Members should participate as much as possible in debates and votes.

Aid goal
The platform must serve as a tool for mutual aid between citizens. Administrators do not control the community. As long as they are assessed positively, it must give them all the support possible.

Control objective
Everyone is elected for an indefinite period. As long as 75% of the community approves the work of the elected official, he remains in office. The community has constant censorship over its elected officials.

Objective of representativeness
there is no limit to the number of elected officials. As long as the community needs representatives, or is no longer unanimous, applications are open.















Objectivity

Objective of neutrality of elected officials
Platform members must elect impartial spokespersons. Spokespeople will be able to express their personal political opinions through the platform but should only express common political decisions in public.

Precision objective
Each elected official will be judged on the precision with which he reports the common opinion. He must therefore be a specialist in the subject treated.

Equality goal
Each individuality constituting the whole, no opinion can be censored or completely ignored. As an example, we know with hindsight that education is an effective way to combat social exclusion. Instead of ignoring acts of exclusion, target the perpetrators and educate them.

Objectivity objective
Members must be objective and take into account the maximum of parameters when solving a problem.

Objective of independence
The platform should not be subject to any censorship by any existing system. If the organization is sufficient, the only possible measure is the complete blocking of the platform. An administrator must be able to resign if he considers that he can no longer maintain the platform. A sufficient number of administrators is therefore necessary.
The servers will be hosted all over the world.

Transparency objective
No censorship and no secret can exist. All financial accounts, service providers, source code, etc. will be public.









Integration

Continuity
The fundamental principles of this gathering are republican and democratic. Freed from religious, national and cultural issues.

Universality goal
Final decisions must be made through clear unity. The platform must bring together the maximum of people, all opinions combined. It must also be available in all languages.

Sustainability goal
As the project progresses, the number of changes that can be made in a time interval will decrease. The project will be classified according to this ratio (change / week / month +% acceptance).

Evolution objective
the platform is an intermediate step. Thereafter, it is necessary to register the procedures within the existing political framework in each country.

Investment objective
All citizens must work to create funding models. Common funds will be created and used for lucrative or non-lucrative projects, set up according to the models. The community invested in employment, research, administration.

Objective of achievement
Integration into the political framework will have to take place at the ballot box. The existing deputies will have to present the bills validated by the community. Eventually the polling stations will be opened like all administrations.
