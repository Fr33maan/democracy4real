# BEFORE POSTING AN ISSUE 
Read `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` and `CONSTITUTION` in your language, `ROADMAP`.

# Goals
The final goal is to create laws by ourselves, fully accepted by a large portion of the participants and fully integrable in the present law system by the current institutions.
They must be legal law projects.

We need to be able to have constructive discussions 
It should be impossible to manipulate people mind through the platform
It must follow the constitution principles
